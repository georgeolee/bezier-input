# bezier-input-react

A cubic Bezier component with interactive control points. When the user moves a point, the component creates a lookup table for the new curve and passes it to an `onChange` handler. 

The lookup table is just a standard javascript array of numbers, representing the approximate height of the curve at regular intervals across the width of the graph. The default lookup `resolution` is 64 entries. More details below.

### Lookup Interpolation

![bezier_comparison_compressed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62530485/169634721-63925d24-38a2-4b42-864e-a6f092776711.gif)

Bezier curves are written as parametric equations. This makes it hard to get y in terms of some arbitrary x, even though this is almost always how we think about using a curve as a control input. Throw moving control points into the mix and it's even more of a mess because the Bezier equations keep changing.

To create a useful curve representation for looking up values by x, the component uses an initial sample set (the red graph) to interpolate values for y at regular x intervals (the green graph). This means the curve can be represented as a simple 1D array of y values. 

With a constant step size for x, reproducing the curve is as easy as looping through the array, and looking up y in terms of x is straightforward. Each index represents an x increment of `1 / (resolution - 1)`. 

There's some accuracy loss with to this approach, but it should work well enough for a slider-style input. You can bump up `resolution` to get a closer approximation as needed â€“ the example here is intentionally crunchy for clarity :slightly_smiling_face:

### Control Point Constraints

You can set initial control points other than the default ones as long as they fit the constraints below. The graph area spans from (0, 0) in the bottom left to (1, 1) in the top right. If any coordinate falls outside the permitted range for some reason, the component will try to scale/translate the curve to fit the graph area. 

Note that P<sub>0</sub> and P<sub>3</sub> are drawn slightly differently to avoid obscuring the ends of the curve, so they won't appear to line up with P<sub>1</sub>/P<sub>2</sub> even when their coordinates are identical. This difference is visual only.

| point | x | y | default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P<sub>0</sub> | 0 | 0 to 1 | (0, 0) |
| P<sub>1</sub> | 0 to 1 | 0 to 1 | (0, 1) |
| P<sub>2</sub> | 0 to 1 | 0 to 1 | (1, 0) |
| P<sub>3</sub> | 1 | 0 to 1 | (1, 1) |
